            <p id="abt_a">
                Successful education depends on many aspects. The IT Institute<br> 
                considers cooperation with qualified companies in the media industry<br> 
                to be an important factor. This is not only about access to the latest<br>
                software and hardware, but above all about important teaching content.<br>
                In addition to the IT Institute, our students benefit first and foremost<br>
                from teaching materials and the exchange of learning plans and teaching<br> 
                strategies. The constant contact between the students and the media experts<br>
                in class, through meetings or master classes ensures a constant exchange of<br> 
                exciting specialist knowledge. Students also gain deep insights into the world<br>
                of work as well as the latest technologies and collect valuable experience.
